Note:-- if you configure the storage class, you will create the PVC(persistent volume claim) directly, claim will create the volume with the help of storage class

Note:-- while creating the volume we can menction the access mode. And it will not support all the access modes
        hostPath---> supports  ReadWriteOnce
        EBS-------->  supports  ReadWriteOnce
        if we want multiple nodes to mount a single volume -------->supports ReadWriteMany

AccessModes
===========
ReadWriteOnce--> volume can be mounted as read-write by single node
ReadWriteMany--> volume can be mounted as read-write by many node-----> supports nfs
ReadOnlyMany--> volume can be mounted as read-only by many node

Note:- here PVC is directly associated with pv. So while creating the pvc we can give a clime polocies

Cliam polocies
===============
Retain---> when pvc is deleted. pv will not be deleted 
Delete----> when we delete  pvc. it will delete pv and also associated external storage such as
            AWS EBS,GPED, AzureDisk.
Recycle--->when we delete pvc it will not delete pv. but it will remove data from the storage.


Here i have 2 persistent volumes when you are creating the PVC, what opctions/factors it will use to associate with PV? 
======================================================================================================================
it will match with  storageClassName
                    accessmodes
                    requests
For example i am tryning to create a pvc with AccessMode ReadWriteOnce, suppose if i have a two volumes with ReadWriteOnce, here one is already claimed by some one else
and one is avilable, here it will consider the volume which is not climed by any one
